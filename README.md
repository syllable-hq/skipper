# Syllable's Home Website


This website is built on React-Static: "A progressive static site generator for React".

Please see the [React-Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) documentation for more details about this website structure and build processes.

-----

## Development
To run in development, run:
```
yarn start
```


## Production
To build for production, run:
```
yarn build
```
You can test the production build with:
```

Yarn serve just serves the static build from the `/dist` folder. This folder can be deployed to a server to be run as a static build.


## Deploying
The app is running on [netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/). The website will deploy automatically to [syllablehq.com](https://www.syllablehq.com/) when code is pushed to the `master` branch.
